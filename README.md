# [WIP] Laravel-Dashboard

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/melvinversluijs/Laravel-Dashboard/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/melvinversluijs/Laravel-Dashboard/tree/master)

A dashboard application build using Laravel. Since this is a personal project I will be pushing
directly to the master branch.

## Testing

Running all tests in order can be done by using the `composer run test` command.

### PHP CodeSniffer

The `composer run test:phpcs` command will run the PHP CodeSniffer test.

### PHPStan

You can use the `composer run test:phpstan` command to run the phpstan test.

### PHPUnit

Running PHPUnit tests can be done by using the `composer run test:phpunit` command.
